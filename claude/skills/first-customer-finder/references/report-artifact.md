# Report Artifact

Create a standalone HTML report from the final qualified prospect data. Use the bundled generator instead of writing report markup manually.

## Generate

```bash
python3 <skill-base-dir>/scripts/generate_report.py analysis.json outputs/first-customer-finder-report.html
```

Return the absolute report path as a clickable link in the final response. Keep the JSON in a work or temporary directory unless the user asks for raw data.
